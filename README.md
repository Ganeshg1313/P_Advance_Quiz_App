# P_Advance_Quiz_App
<br>
## While making the App I have learned following things :
<br>
1 => How to use localStorage methods<br>
2 => How to fetch the questions from the public API(Open Trivia DB)<br>
3 => Use of JSON methods and the array methods<br>
4 => How to create a loader<br>
<br>
## Working
<br>
1 => 1st the User will see the Home page.<br>
2 => Then the user can either start to play or see the high scores(if any)(He will only able to see the Top 5 scores)<br>
3 => After clicking on the start to play the user will be able to see the quesitons and the choices and in the heads up display he can see the question number and the progress bar and the current score<br>
4 => After the last question the user will be redirected to the end page where he will be able to see the final score and if he want to store the score then he need to enter the username and click on the save button and then he will automatically redirected to the home page<br>
5 => If he does not want to save the score he can choose to play again or see the high score<br>
